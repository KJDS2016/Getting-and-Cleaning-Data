The data in this table represents a subset of merged test and train  data, the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, grouped by subject and then activity. 

VARIABLES

1. subject 
Integer variable. 
Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
Its range is from 1 to 30. 
Data source is "subject_text.txt" and "subject_train.txt" subsetted by measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

2. activity 
Factor variable with 6 levels: 1. WALKING, 2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4. SITTING, 5. STANDING, 6. LAYING
Data source is a "Y_test.txt" and "Y_train.txt" subsetted by measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Continuous numeric variables representing measurements (in Hz). The data source (features_info.text) states that the measurements are (paraphrasing as follows):

. . .from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeaccelerometer-XYZ and timegyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timebodyaccelerometer-XYZ and timegravityaccelerometer-XYZ). The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timebodyaccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timebodygyroJerk-XYZ). The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timebodyaccelerometerMag, timegravityaccelerometerMag, timebodyaccelerometerJerkMag, timebodygyroMag, timebodygyrojerkMag). A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencybodyaccelerometer-XYZ, frequencybodyaccelerometerjerk-XYZ, frequencybodygyro-XYZ, frequencygodyaccelerometerjerkMag, frequencybodygyroMag, frequencybodygyrojerkMag.  

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
timebodyaccelerometer-XYZ
timegravityaccelerometer-XYZ
timebodyaccelerometerJerk-XYZ
timeBodyGyro-XYZ
timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
timeBodyAccMag
timeGravityAccMag
timeBodyAccJerkMag
timetBodyGyroMag
timeBodyGyroJerkMag
frequencyBodyAcc-XYZ
frequencyBodyAccJerk-XYZ
frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ
frequencyfBodyAccMag
frequencyBodyAccJerkMag
frequencyBodyGyroMag
frequencyBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation

The data source states that additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
