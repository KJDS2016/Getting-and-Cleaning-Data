The features above come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timebodyaccelerometer-XYZ and timegravityaccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timebodyaccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timebodygyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timebodyaccelerometerMag, timegravityaccelerometerMag, timebodyaccelerometerJerkMag, timebodygyroMag, timebodygyrojerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencybodyaccelerometer-XYZ, frequencybodyaccelerometerjerk-XYZ, frequencybodygyro-XYZ, frequencygodyaccelerometerjerkMag, frequencybodygyroMag, frequencybodygyrojerkMag.  

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle variable:
